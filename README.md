# Tukey's Lemma and Axiom of Choice

Axiom of Choice (AC) is an important axiom in axiomatic set theory and it has a wide range of applications in modern mathematics. 
In this work, we formalize AC and Tukey's lemma. We prove the equivalence between them in Coq. The work is based on the``axiomatic set theory'' formal system that we developed.
